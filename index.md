# Prowl

![Prowl](media/prowl-logo.jpg)

Prowl is an open-source, **[MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md)** game engine developed in **pure C# in latest .NET**, (which surprisingly has **no runtime fees** believe it or not! ðŸ˜®).

It aims to provide a seamless transition for developers familiar with _Unity_ by maintaining a similar API while also following KISS and staying as small and customizable as possible. Ideally, _Unity_ projects can port over with as little resistance as possible.
